### What is this? ###
This repository contains a Python script that outputs a Bash script. The Bash script is designed to be run on SLURM, specifically, the SLURM at USF's Research Computing cluster. The Python script requires an input file containing the locations of a directory of RNA-seq reads in FASTQ format, a GTF file, and a genome index file in FASTA format.

### How do I use this? ###
Currently this repository is not written for widespread dissemination but maybe you can get some idea from it for your own work.
