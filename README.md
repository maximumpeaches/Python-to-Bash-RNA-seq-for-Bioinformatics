### What is this? ###
This repository contains a Python script that outputs a Bash script given an input file. The Bash script and input file are examples of what it would look like to run the Python script.

The Bash script is designed to be run on SLURM, specifically, the SLURM at USF's Research Computing cluster. The Python script requires an input file containing the locations of 1) a directory of RNA-seq reads in FASTQ format, 2) a GTF file, and 3) a genome index file in FASTA format.
