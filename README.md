### What is this? ###
This repository contains a Python script that outputs a Bash script given an input file. To run the program the user would edit the input file and then type `python slurm_generator.py`, which would automate the creation of several files and submission to the USF Research Computing cluster. The input file contains the locations of a directory containing RNA-seq reads, a GTF file, and a genome index in FASTA format.
